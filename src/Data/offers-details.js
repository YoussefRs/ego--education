        description : "Sustainable Development is a fast growing discipline within areas of study that complement such growth, thereby developing in tandem. It requires researchers who can collect and analyse information from multiple academic disciplines. Furthermore, they have to interpret those findings and translate their interpretation into action plans for policy and decision makers, contributing to the transformation and creation of policies and the generation of reform. For this reason, the MSc in Sustainable Development towards an Inclusive and Equitable Global Society: Economic, Sociocultural, Ecological Dimensions is an interdisciplinary programme presenting “alternative” narratives and paradigms in contrast to the dominant meta narratives across the key modules. The students will be free to collaborate with scholars across the various disciplines on original interdisciplinary research. In so doing, students will help create new fields of inquiry that will have a wide impact in many aspects of daily life. ",
